## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS FOR PHASE 3**

### **Immediate Priorities**

1. **Create User Dashboard**: Implement `/user/dashboard` route and component
2. **Create Public Tournament Browsing**: Implement `/public/tournaments`
3. **Organize Existing Features**: Move current features to `/organizer/` structure

### **Route Migration Plan**

```typescript
// Current Routes → New Routes
'/tournaments' → '/organizer/tournaments' (for creation/management)
'/tournaments' → '/public/tournaments' (for browsing)
'/teams' → '/organizer/teams' (for management)
'/teams' → '/public/teams' (for browsing)
'/dashboard' → '/user|organizer|admin/dashboard' (role-based)
```
